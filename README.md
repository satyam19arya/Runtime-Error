Problem Statement : In the markets of health insurance, if a policy holder has a pre-existing medical condition his premium costs go up and coverage goes down. The policy Holder is simply left sulking as to why his cost has gone up. 

To bring about the transparency between the Policy Holder and the Insurance Provider, we propose the development of a common metric which we call as the health score. A user can go on our website fill out a small survey and chech his Health Score. Users can also head over to our community discussion forum and share their problems and ispiring stories with other members of the community.
